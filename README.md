# enigma-exposed

The Enigma machine was used by the Nazis during WW2 to encrypt war communications.

The machine was used already before the start of the war.  
In the 1930s, the Polish Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Różycki and Henryk Zygalski had already broken Enigma.

However, by the start of WW2, the German cryptographers had increased Enigma’s security.  
Only after the start of the war, Alan Turing and his team managed to break it again, at Bletchley Park.

## Goals of this project

This project has the following educational purposes:

- Show how the Enigma machine works, simulating each mechanical component,
  including the rotors, the plug board, the reflector, and ring settings,
  with a Python implementation enriched by documentation on each component, for the curious reader.
- Show different ways to break the Enigma machine, in particular:
  - How it was broken during WW2 at Bletchley Park;
  - How we can break it in modern times, thanks to the increased computational power available today.
